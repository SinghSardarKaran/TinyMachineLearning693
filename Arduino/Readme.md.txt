>I have defined My LED to be red color

> While defining setUp function I have used red so by default of you give LED_BUILTIN you would see yellow color  

>As directed to use loop function inside it I have initialized two variables of Data Type Float called 'insideL' and 'outsideL'.

>I determined the values and tried setting the values from higher level brightness. 

>I have taken angle of 90 degrees  since sin 90 is 1 which is max brightness.

>To convert angle 90 into radians multiplied it with 0.01745 since
6.282/360 = 0.01745

> therefore 90*0.01745=1.570


>To convert the output of the sine function to LED light intensity used the below formula

sin(in) * 127.5 + 127.5

>I have utilized analogWrite function to get the output
